## Supported Devices
The demo runs well (>= 120 fps) on most modern computers provided they support WebGL 2 and the `EXT_color_buffer_half_float` extension. It usually runs better on Chromium-based browsers rather than Firefox or Safari. It performs decently on most phones too but the touchscreen controls are not properly implemented yet.

## Controls
- Move around the terrain with the `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` keys.
- Hold down `shift` to sprint.
- Look around using the mouse.
- Press `/` to start typing a command.
